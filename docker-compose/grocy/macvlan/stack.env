# Grocy Environment Variables

# These environment variables affect PHP and the grocy application
# For a full list of grocy settings, see config-dist.php in the main grocy repo:
#
#       https://github.com/grocy/grocy/blob/master/config-dist.php
#
# Grocy application settings must be prefixed with 'GROCY_'.
#
# For example, if we'd like to configure grocy to use Euros (EUR):
#
#       Setting('CURRENCY', 'USD');
#
# Then we would set 
GROCY_CURRENCY=EUR
